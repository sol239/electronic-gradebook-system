# PROJECT ANALYSIS REPORT - VDA School Management System

**Author:** David Válek  
**Date:** 2025-08-19  
**Project:** VDA School Management System (Oracle SQL)  
**Deadline:** End of August 2025 (Recommended: End of summer semester exam period)

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Your project is a **School Management System** (similar to Bakaláři.cz) that manages students, teachers, subjects, grades, lectures, and class schedules. This is an excellent foundation for a database application project.

---

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY COMPLETED

### 1. **Database Schema Structure** ✅
- **18 tables** with proper relationships
- **Primary keys** with identity columns (artificial keys)
- **Foreign key constraints** properly defined
- **Unique constraints** on natural keys (email, names, etc.)

### 2. **PL/SQL Packages** ✅
- **20 packages** with CRUD operations
- **Natural key conversion functions** implemented (e.g., `get_person_id_by_email`)
- **Proper error handling** with `DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX`, `NO_DATA_FOUND`, `TOO_MANY_ROWS`
- **Transaction management** with commit/rollback

### 3. **Indexing Strategy** ✅
- **47 indexes** successfully created
- **Foreign key indexes** for all relationships
- **Date column indexes** for time-based queries
- **Composite indexes** for common query patterns
- **Performance indexes** for name lookups

### 4. **Views** ✅
- **8 views** representing different "screens" of the application
- **Student grades, lectures, class information**
- **Teacher subjects and lectures**
- **Parent-student relationships**

### 5. **Triggers** ✅
- **3 triggers** for data integrity
- **Before insert/update triggers** for validation

---

## ❌ WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED/IMPROVED

### 1. **Constraint Naming** ❌ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** Some constraints don't have explicit names, making error detection difficult.

**Examples found:**
```sql
-- In tbl_lecture.sql - GOOD (explicit naming)
constraint uq_lecture_subject_id_classroom_id_start_time unique (subject_id, classroom_id, start_time)

-- In some tables - BAD (missing explicit names)
constraint fk_lecture_subject foreign key ( subject_id ) references subject ( subject_id )
```

**Action Required:** Add explicit names to ALL constraints:
```sql
constraint fk_lecture_subject foreign key ( subject_id ) references subject ( subject_id ),
constraint fk_lecture_classroom foreign key ( classroom_id ) references classroom ( classroom_id )
```

### 2. **Natural Key Coverage** ❌ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** Some entity tables lack natural keys that identify instances in the real world.

**Missing Natural Keys:**
- `tbl_lecture` - Missing natural key for lecture identification
- `tbl_grade_group_student` - Missing natural key for grade identification
- `tbl_class_group_student` - Missing natural key for group membership

**Action Required:** Add natural keys to all entity tables:
```sql
-- Example for lecture table
constraint uq_lecture_natural_key unique (subject_id, classroom_id, start_time, lecture_name)
```

### 3. **Data Integrity Issues** ❌ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Some tables reference columns that don't exist in referenced tables.

**Example Found:**
```sql
-- In tbl_lecture.sql - classroom_id references classroom table
-- But need to verify classroom table has proper structure
```

**Action Required:** Verify all foreign key references and ensure referenced tables exist with proper primary keys.

### 4. **Multi-User Concurrency** ❌ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Missing row locking mechanisms for concurrent access.

**Action Required:** Implement `FOR UPDATE` clauses in critical operations:
```sql
-- Example in package procedures
SELECT * FROM student WHERE student_id = p_student_id FOR UPDATE;
```

### 5. **CHECK Constraints** ❌ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Missing data validation constraints.

**Examples Needed:**
```sql
-- Grade validation
constraint chk_grade_range check (grade >= 1 and grade <= 5)

-- Date validation
constraint chk_start_before_end check (start_time < end_time)

-- Email format validation
constraint chk_email_format check (email like '%@%.%')
```

---

## 🔧 SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. **Fix Constraint Naming in All Tables**

**Files to update:**
- `tables/tbl_*.sql` - Add explicit names to all constraints
- `packages/pkg_*.sql` - Ensure all procedures handle constraint violations properly

### 2. **Add Missing Natural Keys**

**Tables needing natural keys:**
- `tbl_lecture` - Add unique constraint on (subject_id, classroom_id, start_time, lecture_name)
- `tbl_grade_group_student` - Add unique constraint on (grade_group_id, student_id, grade_date)
- `tbl_class_group_student` - Add unique constraint on (class_group_id, student_id)

### 3. **Implement Row Locking**

**Packages needing row locking:**
- `pkg_student` - Lock student records during grade updates
- `pkg_lecture` - Lock lecture records during scheduling
- `pkg_grade_group` - Lock grade records during modifications

### 4. **Add CHECK Constraints**

**Tables needing validation:**
- `tbl_grade_group_student` - Grade range validation
- `tbl_lecture` - Time validation (start < end)
- `tbl_person` - Email format validation

---

## 📚 MISSING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **Application Description** ❌
**Missing:** Clear description of what the application does and its purpose.

**Action Required:** Update `01_create_schema.sql` with:
- Application purpose and scope
- Description of each table and its business meaning
- Description of package procedures and their parameters

### 2. **Test Script** ❌
**Missing:** Comprehensive test script showing all functionality.

**Action Required:** Create `06_test_application.sql` with:
- Tests for all package procedures
- Tests for all views
- Error condition tests (duplicate data, invalid data, etc.)
- Tests for concurrent access scenarios

### 3. **Statistics Management** ❌
**Missing:** Scripts for database statistics management.

**Action Required:** Verify `03_create_stats.sql` and `04_delete_stats.sql` work properly.

### 4. **Schema Reset** ❌
**Missing:** Proper schema reset functionality.

**Action Required:** Verify `07_reset_schema.sql` properly drops and recreates the entire schema.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediately:** Fix constraint naming in all table files
2. **This Week:** Add missing natural keys and CHECK constraints
3. **Next Week:** Implement row locking and test concurrency
4. **Final Week:** Complete documentation and testing

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Start with constraint naming** - This is quick to fix and improves error detection
2. **Focus on natural keys** - These are essential for real-world data identification
3. **Test incrementally** - Fix one component at a time and test thoroughly
4. **Document as you go** - Update comments and descriptions while making changes

Your project has an excellent foundation and is very close to completion. The main work remaining is in data integrity, constraint naming, and testing rather than major structural changes.
